## Tatiana Nantes

I'm an ex product manager who (not so) secretely dreamt of becoming a software engineer. I'm curious and I thrive on challenges that push me out of my confort zone. I'm very interested in the world of cybersecurity and AI and security by design. 

My growth mindset means at any point in time I'll most likely be learning something new. I have an international profile having worked, studied and lived in Europe, the US and Africa.

In my product career I have lead cross functional teams (Product, UX/UI, Engineering) and together we have built products that are used around the world, and I'm looking for a role where I can expand this journey as an engineer, whilst bringing all of the transferable skills and learnings from my past experience. 

Tech Skills : Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Java
