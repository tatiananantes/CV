## Who am I?
I was previously a Head of Product who always wanted to become a software engineer. I taught myself how to code and was quickly hooked and knew this was something I was really passionate about. So here I am - a Junior Full Stack Software Engineer - having completed my postgrad studies in Computer Science last year and <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">Makers Academy</a> Full Stack Bootcamp in January '22. 

I'm curious and I thrive on challenges that take me out of my confort zone and allow me to use my problem solving skills. I have an international profile having worked, studied and lived in Europe, the US and Africa and speak 5 languages. 

During my journey at Makers I really enjoyed writing tested, clean and concise code that is easy to understand and reuse. 

## What am I looking for?
I am looking for roles which have a good support structure for junior engineers where I can learn and grow whilst contributing to the team and the product earlier on.
Ideally I'd also be looking to work in an Agile environment as I find this is where I do my best work as an active member of a cross functional team.  
I have a keen interest in AI, CyberSecurity and DevOps and I like solving problems and find the best tech to do it. If that requires learning a new language I'll happily spend my time working out where the semi-colons go!

## What will I bring to the role
My current stack: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Capybara, RSpec, Javascript, Node.js, Express, Jest, React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Django, SQL, Heroku, AWS and Git. 

Also, with a decade of experience in product I'll bring other relevant transferable skills such as:
- Experience in fully remote environments with international teams (including hybrid, internal and outsourced teams) since 2017
- Experience with agile (and waterfall) environments and frameworks, working as part of self managed cross functional teams (UX/UI, product, enginnering, platform, devOps etc)
- Experience in digital transformations and legacy systems
- Prioritisation, story pointing, retros, refinement, etc. I know what problem to solve first (and which not solve), understand tech dependencies and constraints, the importance of testing and how crucial good communication is. 
- I have built SaaS products, internal tools (sales and CMS - proprietary and Adobe), ETL's, microservices, API's, aggregators (travel and property), search tools (Algolia), AI/ML and more

## Skills

### Inquisitive
I'm always digging into a new subject or picking up a new skill. This could be just for fun, like learning the violin or how not to die whilst riding a longboard, or something to further improve my career such as learning to code when I was a product manager to take on some of the tasks off the engineering team. I also learnt Django and React whilst building the final 2 week project as I wanted to learn new languages that I had not used before. 

### Communication
As a product manager I spent a lot of time translating user and stakeholder into engineering and back again. I believe that if everybody is on the same page and understands exactly who's doing what, when and why everything runs smoother and products do what they're supposed to. 

### Adaptable
New environments, languages, countries, cultures, teams or challenges haven't stopped me from succeding no matter what. Ask me about my time working in a concrete factory in the Tunisian outback.
